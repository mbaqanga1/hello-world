# hello-world
A collection of files on my journey to web design
I am an educator teaching scince math and business in Tokyo Japan. I have lived in Japan for over 30 years.
It has always been my desire to make a web page and learn the technology behind it.
As part of self improvement I decided to launch into this project since it falls within my summer break.
I am looking forward to it.
Happy coding.
